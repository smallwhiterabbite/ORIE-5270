Topics covered today:
1. AWS - The most important feature of aws is that it is cloud-enabled, allowing users to have access to linux system with
   extensively larger compute capacity compared to using our own systems.
2. Linux system - It is an operating system like windows, but Linux is programming-based that we can access and change
   anything with codes. It is also highly securely (eg. when we type in passcodes to access Github, the password will
   not show up). 
3. Git and Github - Git is the command used to manage Github, an social network for computer scientists to share codes.
   Specifically we learned the following concepts in Github:
	a. Repository - like a file which collects all files related to a certain project and we can manage using Linux
	b. Branch - super useful when working on a group project; teammates can work on their own codes before pushing 
	   finalized codes into the master branch
4. Shell - Shell is the standard command language for systems like Linux. One of its useful application is that we can use
   sh to run existing files with functions we want (eg. we can use sh to write a loop to run same py files with different 
   seed numbers).
5. Python and PyCharm - We learned Python classes today. Like other object-oriented progammming languages, class collects
   fields and methods to build object and its functionality together. We also covered data structure concepts including trees
   and recursive functions.
